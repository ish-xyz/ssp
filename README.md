### SSP stands for Self Service Portal

It's a rest API with a small web user interface that let's you define Kubernetes job templates and run them to perform tasks.

You don't need to redefine the jobs all the time, you can keep a single or a set of templates and let the users trigger predefined actions when they need it.

The only requirement is a Kubernetes cluster.
